# Data Structures and Algorithms University Project

This repository contains the project completed as part of the **"Data Structures and Algorithms"** course at Technincal University of Crete. The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of **six different list implementations** in memory (RAM). Each list implementation is evaluated based on specific operations, and the results are analyzed to understand their efficiency and trade-offs.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement and compare **six versions of lists** in Java (or another programming language). The list implementations are:

1. **DList**: Doubly Linked List.
2. **SDList**: Sorted Doubly Linked List.
3. **AAList**: Array-Based List with Automatic Resizing.
4. **SAAList**: Sorted Array-Based List with Automatic Resizing.
5. **AList**: Array-Based List with Fixed Capacity.
6. **SAList**: Sorted Array-Based List with Fixed Capacity.

Each list implementation is tested on specific operations (e.g., insertion, deletion, search), and performance metrics are recorded and analyzed.
